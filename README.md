Security Threats from Agentic AI 
• Context 
The rise of Agentic AI,AI systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and operate 
persistently over time has introduced a new class of cyber threats. Unlike traditional malware 
or passive AI systems, agentic AIs are capable of goal-driven behavior, self-modification, 
and even coordination with other agents, making them significantly harder to detect and 
defend against. 


• Problem Overview 
Modern AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent frameworks, 
can be repurposed or exploited to perform malicious actions autonomously. These agentic AIs 
can initiate tasks such as phishing, data exfiltration, or system manipulation with minimal 
human oversight, posing serious threats to cybersecurity infrastructure. 
The security community currently lacks robust frameworks and detection systems tailored for 
autonomous, adaptive, and persistent threats from AI agents. 



• Threat Examples 
1. Malicious Use of LLMs 
Autonomous agents may misuse LLMs to generate realistic phishing emails, automate 
social engineering, or create deepfake content for impersonation attacks. 
2. AI-Enabled Phishing or Impersonation 
Agentic AI can continuously engage with targets over email, chat, or voice gathering 
information, adjusting tactics, and improving attack success rates over time. 
3. Self-Replicating or Persistent Agents 
Autonomous AI scripts can deploy themselves across networks or cloud systems, 
maintain persistent access, and evolve their own behaviors. 
4. Data Exfiltration via Autonomous Bots 
Bots can navigate systems, locate sensitive data, and exfiltrate it over encrypted or 
covert channels all without direct hacker input. 
5. Prompt Injection or Model Manipulation 
Attackers may inject hidden instructions into prompts that hijack AI behavior, leading 
to unauthorized data access, leakage, or misuse. 
6. Swarm Attacks by Multiple Agents 
A coordinated group of AI agents may launch a distributed attack each with 
specialized roles similar to botnet behavior, but with far greater intelligence and 
adaptability.



• The Core Problem 
Traditional security systems are not designed to detect, understand, or defend against 
autonomous and intelligent agents. 
There is an urgent need to develop AI-native security frameworks that: 
• Monitor agent behaviors across time 
• Detect prompt-based manipulation 
• Identify autonomous decision-making patterns 
• Respond automatically and adaptively to AI-driven threats 



• Objective 
To design and build an AI-powered security system that can: 
• Collect behavioral and communication data from agents 
• Detect anomalous or malicious autonomous behavior using ML/LLM models 
• Trigger automated containment, alerts, or human review 
• Continuously learn and adapt to emerging agentic threat patterns
